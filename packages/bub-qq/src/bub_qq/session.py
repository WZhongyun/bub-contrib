"""Shared per-session state for QQ inbound tracking and passive replies.

All state containers here are bounded so a long-running process cannot
grow without limit: once ``max_entries`` is exceeded, the least recently
written entries are evicted. Losing an old entry only means an old
session can no longer receive a passive reply, which QQ would reject
anyway once its reply window expires.
