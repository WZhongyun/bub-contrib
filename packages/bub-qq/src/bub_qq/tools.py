"""Native tools and ops comma commands for the QQ channel.

``qq.send`` is the reply tool for ``reply_mode="tool"``: direct model
output is routed to the "null" channel, so calling the tool is the only
way a reply reaches the chat and *not* calling it is how the model stays
silent. It reuses the channel's send services, so passive
``msg_id``/``msg_seq`` targeting, dedupe and the active-message fallback
all behave exactly as in direct mode.

Tools registered with ``agent_use=False`` are ops comma commands: they
never appear in the model's tool list and can only be requested as
``,name`` by admins; every comma command still passes the Guard.
